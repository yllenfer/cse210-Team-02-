# Snake
How many apples can a snake eat before it gets too big? Play this arcade classic 
to find out! The rules are simple. Move the snake with the W, A, S, D keys. 
Every time you eat an apple the snake grows. If you run into yourself the game 
is over.
## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and asciimatics 1.12.0 or new installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Asciimatics by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install asciimatics
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
